When doGet() method of servlet gets called?        
A. A GET request results from a normal request for a URL
B. The service() method checks the HTTP request type as GET and calls doGet() method
(1 Point)

Only A

Only B

Both A & B

None of the above
Ans:-
The doGet() method of a servlet gets called when a GET request is made to the servlet. So, the correct answer is:

B. The service() method checks the HTTP request type as GET and calls doGet() method

When a client sends a GET request for a URL that is mapped to a servlet, the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) invokes the service() method of the servlet, and within the service() method, it checks the HTTP request type. If the request is a GET request, it calls the doGet() method of the servlet to handle the GET request.

So, option B is the correct answer.
